# Party
Java Application to solve "Party" problem using a dynamic programming programming approach. 

Alice wants to throw a party and is deciding whom to call. She has N people to
choose from, and she has made up a list of which pairs of these people know each
other. She wants to pick as many people as possible, subject to two constraints:
at the party, each person should have at least k1 other people whom they know
and k2 other people whom they don’t know. (Note that you can’t know or not
know yourself. You don’t count in your own computation.)
